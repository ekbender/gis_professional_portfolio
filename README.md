# GIS Professional Portfolio
Academic and professional experiences all in one place.

Hello,
my name is Emily and I am a May 2025 graduate from the Master's of Geographic Information Science Program at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. On top of my academic experience, I have 2 years worth of professional GIS work from my time at U-Spatial, University of Minnesota. This portfolio is a digital record of my proudest projects, utilizing a number of skills and softwares such as, but not limited to: SQL, DBeaver, Python, Excel, ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Online. 

## Projects

### Office of the Minnesota State Auditor Dashboards
During this 2-year project with the Office of the State Auditor (OSA), my coworkers and I have published a set of dashboards for several governmental divisions to be accessed by internal stakeholders and the public for increased statewide financial transparency. We underwent an accessibility review with WeCo to make all dashboards as accessible as possible with the most current Esri technology. We have also created technical documentation for the smooth transfer of knowledge to OSA's IT department. Through this project, I have been able to hone skills in web app development, including but not limited to writing arcade code, styling web maps, and reshaping datasets for the purposes of app design.

### Exploratory Data Analysis of Gentrification Factors in the Riverwest neighborhood of Milwaukee, WI
For a class project, I chose to explore several key gentrification factors in my home city of Milwaukee, specifically focusing on three zip codes, located in the Riverwest neighborhood. To do this, I found data at the zip code level to compare to citywide trends. I created a database schema to structure my questions and wrote several SQL queries to gain some insights. This project consisted of the creation of an Entity Relationship diagram, loading various types of data into a SQL database and querying the data using various methods, such as sub queries, common table expressions, and joins.
