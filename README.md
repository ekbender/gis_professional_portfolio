# GIS Professional Portfolio
Academic and professional experiences all in one place.

Hello,
my name is Emily and I am a May 2025 graduate from the Master's of Geographic Information Science Program at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. On top of my academic experience, I have 2 years worth of professional GIS work from my time at U-Spatial, University of Minnesota. This portfolio is a digital record of my proudest projects, utilizing a number of skills and softwares such as, but not limited to: SQL, DBeaver, Python, Excel, ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Online. 

## Projects

### Office of the Minnesota State Auditor Dashboards
During this 2-year project with the Office of the State Auditor (OSA), my coworkers and I have published a set of dashboards for several governmental divisions to be accessed by internal stakeholders and the public for increased statewide financial transparency. We underwent an accessibility review with WeCo to make all dashboards as accessible as possible with the most current Esri technology. We have also created technical documentation for the smooth transfer of knowledge to OSA's IT department. Through this project, I have been able to hone skills in web app development, including but not limited to writing arcade code, styling web maps, and reshaping datasets for the purposes of app design.

### Exploratory Data Analysis of Gentrification Factors in the Riverwest neighborhood of Milwaukee, WI
For a class project, I chose to explore several key gentrification factors in my home city of Milwaukee, specifically focusing on three zip codes, located in the Riverwest neighborhood. To do this, I found data at the zip code level to compare to citywide trends. I created a database schema to structure my questions and wrote several SQL queries to gain some insights. This project consisted of the creation of an Entity Relationship diagram, loading various types of data into a SQL database and querying the data using various methods, such as sub queries, common table expressions, and joins.

### Wild Rice Detection using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Imagery in Northwestern Minnesota
This project allowed me to challenge myself, using data I was unfamiliar with and software I had no prior experience with. By the end of it, I can say that I now have experience with Google Earth Engine, and the complex pre-processing of Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery, as well as interpretation. It took a lot of research up front to understand how I could attempt to do this, but I felt that being in school allowed for a lot of freedom to try and maybe even fail at something.

### Spring 2025 GIS Career Fair
As a GIS Student Organization officer, I had the privilege of organizing and running the annual career fair at the University of Minnesota. This required less technical skills and more soft skills like leadership, adaptability, time management, teamwork and communication. There is a lot of planning and attention to detail that goes into a campus career fair. To pull it off, we needed a lot of people collaborating towards the same end result. Each person has a smaller part to play to get to the career fair and make it a really successful event where students are able to benefit, as well as local employers. 

### Literature Review: Autonomous Agents in GIS
In this literature review paper, I walk through several definitions of "Agent," and get detailed about two common forms of agents in GIS. I really got to hone my academic writing skills, and read about topics that interested me. I learned about the essential properties of agents as laid out by many different authors throughout time, and I got to explore the similarities and differences of Artificial Life Geospatial Agents (ALGA) and Software Geospatial Agents (SGA).
